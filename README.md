# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression Model
Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression. The dataset contains historical data on house prices, which is used to train a predictive model. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

# Tools and Technologies Used
# Python 🐍: 
The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and building the predictive model.
# Pandas 📊:
For efficient data handling and manipulation.
# NumPy 🔢:
To perform numerical computations.
# Scikit-learn 🧠:
Utilized for implementing the linear regression model and other machine learning algorithms.
# Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈:
For data visualization and to plot the regression line and scatter plots.
# Jupyter Notebook 📓: 
To create an interactive environment for coding and documentation
Project Workflow
# Data Collection: 
Gathered historical house price data.
# Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized data trends and relationships.
# Model Training:
Implemented and trained the linear regression model.
# Evaluation: 
Assessed model performance using various metrics.
# Prediction: 
Made predictions on new data and visualized the results.
# Results
The linear regression model was trained with an R² score of 100%.
Visualization of the regression line and scatter plots can be found in the images folder.
